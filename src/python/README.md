# PHYRE

 **PHYRE** is a benchmark for physical reasoning.

It provides a set of physics puzzles in a simulated 2D world. Each puzzle
has a goal state (e.g., *make the green ball touch the blue wall*) and an
initial state in which the goal is not satisfied (see the figure below). A
puzzle can be solved by placing one or more new bodies in the environment
such that when the physical simulation is run the goal is satisfied. An agent
playing this game must solve previously unseen puzzles in as few attempts as
possible.
